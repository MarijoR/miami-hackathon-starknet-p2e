PLAY 2 HELP - GameFi infrastructure enabling games 4 good!

THE CHALLENGE
With our StarkNet infrastructure solution we aim to address several problems:
There is a large gap between game development and blockchain. Game developers encounter barriers as they have to learn how to code smart contracts.
While there are plenty of play2earn games in web3, there is a lack of infrastructure solutions focusing on easily tokenizing games.
Our showcase focuses particularly on charity. We recognized that for end users, barriers to casually donate for charities are high and donations are rarely connected with an appealing user experience.

OUR MISSION
We build GameFi technology which enables developers to tokenize games making an impact.
Our purpose is to build bridges to close the gap between traditional game and blockchain development. With our solution we are enabling on-chain game development, creating a simple adaptable infrastructure to flexibly tokenize games on-chain. Using our infrastructure solution, developers are able to build games that monetize while also having the potential to contribute to a better world. This will then provide gamers a new experience to play games for good and make charity fun.

OUR TECH ECOSYSTEM
We are essentially building on the StarkNet Blockchain, using Cairo. Next to this, we are making technological use of the following:
Starknet: Ecosystem
Skynet: Frontend Host
Argentx Wallet: Login, purchase tickets and receive token rewards
STORJ: Store NFT metadata
NEAR: Mint prize NFT
Coinbase Wallet: UI NFT Host

BUILT ON STARKNET
Using the StarkNet Technology, we take advantage of ZK roll-ups which enable blockchain development at scale. This way we can leverage advantages such as low gas fees, the potential to address the mainstream and the focus on privacy and public goods.

OUR SHOWCASE GAME
In order to showcase our infrastructure solution we built a ready to launch on-chain game which is a combination of play2earn and play2donate gaming. We call it “Play 2 help”. We want the gamers to enjoy playing this fun game and to contribute to making the world a better place. The gamers even have the chance to cash out with a bit of luck and strategy.

The aim of the game is to flood the board in as few moves as possible by strategically selecting colours – each associated with a charitable initiative: Preservation of the rainforest (green), oceans (blue), biodiversity (white), expansion of sustainable transport (red) and solar energy (yellow). Depending on the final colour finishing up the board, the rewards from the game will either go to the respective charity or cash out on the winners’ private wallet (brown).
Every time you win, you will receive an NFT representing the cause you donated to. On top of this, there is an NFT handed out to the top donor of each week.

To participate in the game, you have to buy tokens in advance, allowing you to play the game and – in case you win – giving you the opportunity to multiply your stake, either to donate to your favourite charity or to cash out to your own wallet. There is a statistical probability of 1 in 6 to each outcome, however, if you play with a tactically successful approach, there is a chance to influence the outcome of the final colour.

If you don’t manage to finish the game in 25 moves, you’ll lose your stake to the donation pool, waiting for the next winner to unlock – and to be spent on their respective cause.

USER JOURNEY
The user of our game will start on the landing page, connect their argent wallet and buy tickets to play. With their ticket, they can enter the competition. If they manage to win the game, depending on the outcome / final colour in the game, they will either initiate a transaction to their argent wallet or a transaction to one of five caritative causes. No matter if they win or lose, they will always have the chance to return to buying more tickets.

POTENTIAL IMPACT IN FIGURES

Calculating with 300K daily users in Scaling Phase II (>12 months), a ticket size of $1, five gaming rounds played per user, 10% provider fees, and a 25% cash out quota to private wallets, there could be potential annual donations in charity of $ 369.562.500 and an annual monetizing potential of $ 54.750.000 for the game provider.

SUMMARY
With our StarkNet solution we are providing an easy to build gamefi infrastructure to enable on-chain gaming. Moreover, we built an on-chain ready-to-launch game where gamers have the chance to play for a good cause, with the potential to donate large amounts to charity organisations.
